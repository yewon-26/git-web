        <p>The better part of valor is discretion, in which the better part I have saved my life.</p>
        <p>Life is a long lesson in humility.</p>
        <p>Nothing astonishes men so much as common sense and plain dealing.</p>
        <p>Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to believe.</p>
        <P>Thankfully, beauty is easier to remove than apply, and a swipe of demaquillage in the right direction and you are you once again.</P>
        <p>An idea is salvation by imagination.</p>
        <p>To love deeply in one direction makes us more loving in all others.</p>
        <p>There art two cardinal sins from which all others spring: Impatience and Laziness.</p>
